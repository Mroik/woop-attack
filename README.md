Woop-Attack is a strategy game played over the course of multiple weeks. But
the most important thing in this game is diplomacy and alliances. Inspired by
the video by [People Make Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOYbR-Q_4Hs) it
aims to reproduce the same amount of paranoia and backstabbing while playing the
game.
